# pyspark_dbscan
Python implementation of [Spark DBSCAN](https://github.com/alitouka/spark_dbscan) by alitouka et al, updated to adapt [DBSCAN++](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/jang19a.html) by Jennifer Jang et al.  
Check Spark DBSCAN repository for more information on how the distributed DBSCAN algorithm works.  
As for DBSCAN++, read their paper for an overview of the difference between DBSCAN and DBSCAN++.  
For small datasets, you can find my own improved iterative implementation of DBSCAN++ [here](https://github.com/aboood40091/dbscanpp-py/tree/master).
